advlib-ble
==========

Wireless advertising packet decoding library for Bluetooth Low Energy.  __advlib-ble__ can be used standalone or, more commonly, as a processor module of the protocol-agnostic [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) library.

__advlib-ble__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/advlib-ble) that implements the Core Bluetooth Specification and can be extended with libraries to decode service data and manufacturer-specific data outside of this specification.

| Library | Decodes |
|:--------|:--------|
| [advlib-ble-services](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib-ble-services) | Service Data |
| [advlib-ble-manufacturers](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib-ble-manufacturers) | Manufacturer-Specific Data |


Installation
------------

    npm install advlib-ble


Hello advlib-ble!
-----------------

```javascript
const advlib = require('advlib-ble');

const LIBRARIES = [ require('advlib-ble-services'),
                    require('advlib-ble-manufacturers') ];

let packet = 'c21d04acbe55daba16096164766c6962206279207265656c79416374697665';
let processedPacket = advlib.process(packet, LIBRARIES);

console.log(processedPacket);
```

Which should yield the following console output:

    { rxAdd: "random",
      txAdd: "random",
      type: "ADV_NONCONN_IND",
      length: 29,
      advA: "bada55beac04",
      name: "advlib by reelyActive" }


Options
-------

__advlib-ble__ supports the following options for its process function:

| Property               | Default | Description                         | 
|:-----------------------|:--------|:------------------------------------|
| ignoreProtocolOverhead | false   | Ignore BLE-specific properties (txAdd, length, type, advA, etc.) |
| isPayloadOnly          | false   | Interpret data as the optional PDU payload only (i.e. without header or advertiser address) |
| indices                | []      | URI-lookup indices such as Sniffypedia |

For example, to ignore the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol overhead:

```javascript
let packet = 'c21d04acbe55daba16096164766c6962206279207265656c79416374697665';
let options = { ignoreProtocolOverhead: true };
let processedPacket = advlib.process(packet, [], options);
```

Which should yield the following console output:

    { name: "advlib by reelyActive" }

If only the payload is available, the example above would be handled as follows:

```javascript
let payload = '16096164766c6962206279207265656c79416374697665';
let options = { isPayloadOnly: true };
let processedPayload = advlib.process(packet, [], options);
```

Which should again yield the following console output:

    { name: "advlib by reelyActive" }

For example, to append implicit URIs using the Sniffypedia index:

```javascript
let packet = '401490a3a947507b02011a0aff4c0010050a10b4f1e2';
let options = { indices: [ require('sniffypedia') ] };
let processedPacket = advlib.process(packet, [], options);
```

Which should yield the following console output:

    { uri: "https://sniffypedia.org/Organization/Apple_Inc/" }
